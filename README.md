# Bank Management System Dashboard

An interactive dashboard built to analyze and visualize key financial metrics including loan reports, transaction analyses, and overall bank statistics.

## ‚ú® About The Project

This project transforms raw banking data from multiple sources into a user-friendly dashboard. It provides at-a-glance insights into loan applications, transaction trends, customer demographics, and the bank's physical presence (branches and ATMs). The goal is to empower stakeholders with data-driven insights for better and faster decision-making.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Loan Analysis Report:** In-depth analysis of loan applications, average loan amounts, defaulters, and trends by month and loan term.
- **Transaction Report:** Insights into total transaction volume, value, types, and a geographical view of branch locations.
- **Interactive Visualizations:** Clean and intuitive charts, graphs, and maps for easy data exploration.
